In addition to management structures like grade and organisation, there are also two important cross-government structures that support and organise civil servants: professions and Functions.

**Professions** support individuals in their career specialism, such as: economists, lawyers, policy, operational delivery, and tax inspectors.

**Functions** organise people working on similar supporting services, such as: commercial, human resources (HR), and internal audit.
