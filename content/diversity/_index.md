In this section you can explore statistics about the composition of the Civil Service by different diversity characteristics:

- [sex](sex/)
- [age](age/)
- [ethnicity and national identity](ethnicity/)
- [disability](disability/)
- [sexual orientation](sexual_orientation/)
- [religion or belief](religion_belief/)

On each page you will find information about the overall number of civil servants by diversity category, as well as splits by responsibility level and organisation[^1].

[^1]: While the [statistical tables](/data/) include information by organisation for national identity, sexual orientation and religion or belief, due to data quality issues these bulletin pages do not include visualisations of that data.
