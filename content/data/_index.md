The full statistical tables are [published on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2021). A machine readable format has also been created that makes it easier to work with the data programmatically.

{{< download_file link="../files/acses2021_processed.csv" text="Download the machine readable format" 
     type="CSV" size="11.9MB" >}}

You can also use our [table generator](table_generator/) tool to filter the machine readable file for the selections you are most interested in.
