This site is a work in progress prototype, to demonstrate and test a new approach to publishing the Civil Service Statistics. It is being developed in the open to enable end-user consultation and feedback. All data is from published statistics, however the content is likely to frequently change and therefore should not be relied on for analysis. Moreover, due to the format of the published data files the data reported here is likely to date to 2019. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-statistics" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Civil Service Statistics</a> published on GOV.UK for the official publications and more recent data.

## About the statistics
Civil Service Statistics is an annual National Statistics publication describing the UK Civil Service workforce in terms of its size, demographic characteristics, salaries, working pattern, grade, and location. The data is drawn from the Annual Civil Service Employment Survey (ACSES).

The Civil Service helps the government of the day develop and implement its policies as effectively as possible. It provides services directly to the public, including paying benefits and pensions; running employment services; running prisons and issuing driving licences. Civil Servants also work on policy development and implementation, including analysts, project managers, lawyers and economists. The Civil Service is politically impartial and independent of government. Organisations that make up the Civil Service include central government departments, their agencies, and crown non-departmental government bodies.

These statistics count all home Civil Service employees, including those based in Northern Ireland and overseas. Not included are the Northern Ireland Civil Service, other Crown servants and employees of the wider public sector, for example, employees of non-crown non-departmental public bodies and the National Health Service (NHS). This data presented in the statistics presents departmental information as at 31 March 2021, and will not, therefore, reflect machinery of government changes that have or will take place after this date.

## Notes on the statistics
Unless otherwise specified all figures are calculated on a headcount basis and exclude unknowns for all variables. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 in the case of headcounts, FTE, and salaries, and to one decimal place for percentages. 2021 data in this bulletin is available in the published Civil Service Statistics tables. Where time series are used, data have been taken from previous Civil Service Statistics publications.

### Census 2021 temporary staff
The statistics in this bulletin and the associated data tables exclude 19,310 temporary UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) Census 2021 staff. However, Census 2021 temporary staff feature in the associated GPG data tables (table C) as part of the UKSA breakdown, but are not included in the overall Civil Service GPG figures presented.

### National Statistics
Civil Service Statistics are designated National Statistics in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. National Statistics status means that official statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality, and public value.

All official statistics should comply with the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/). They are awarded National Statistics status following an assessment by the UK Statistics Authority’s regulatory arm. The Authority considers whether the statistics meet the highest standards of Code compliance, including the value they add to public decisions and debate.

Responsibility for the collection and publication of Civil Service Statistics transferred to Cabinet Office from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on 1 October 2018. The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) — the regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority — undertook a compliance check of Civil Service Statistics during December 2019 and January 2020. The OSR confirmed continuing National Statistics designation for Civil Service Statistics in [their letter published 19 February 2020](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/compliance-check-of-civil-service-statistics/).

### The Anual Civil Service Employment Survey (ACSES)
The statistics in the bulletin are derived from returns completed as part of the Annual Civil Service Employment Survey (ACSES). Its scope covers all Civil Service organisations, including all major Departments.

ACSES requests from organisations an individual level record of all their Civil Service employees ‘in post’ as at the reference date, along with records for leavers and joiners from/to the Civil Service in the preceding 12 months. ACSES collects information via a standard Excel template that includes data fields on pay, contractual hours, grade and location. It also includes personal characteristics, such as age, sex, religion, and sexual orientation. The data collected are anonymous in that no employee names are requested. However, the data is considered and handled as ‘personal data’ because in certain circumstances individuals may be identifiable.

Where departmental level figures are quoted these will include the main department and their executive agencies and crown non-departmental public bodies. For Gender Pay Gap however, different aggregations may apply. Given the varied nature of the HR/pay systems within departments, caution should be exercised in comparing statistics across departments

### External sources
Comparative data for the UK workforce on disability and ethnicity are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Labour market overview UK, published on 15 July 2021. Figures in this publication are based on the Labour Force Survey as at March 2021, and include the UK working age population aged 16-64 who are economically active.

### Grading systems and the Senior Civil Service
Organisations within the Civil Service have different grading systems. These have been mapped to common responsibility levels in the statistics presented in this bulletin.

There are two measures of the Senior Civil Service (SCS) available: those formally designated and contracted as members of the Senior Civil Service, and those who are at "SCS level". ACSES measures SCS level employees, which includes a number of health professionals, military personnel, and senior diplomats that are not contractually part of the Senior Civil Service. As such, the Civil Service Statistics release does not contain the official headline figures used for monitoring diversity, pay and other key measures of the Senior Civil Service. These are monitored using the Cabinet Office SCS Database that collects more frequent and comprehensive information on those individuals that make up the Senior Civil Service.

### Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic
When interpreting these statistics, users should note that a number of organisations across the Civil Service will have been affected by the impact of Covid-19.

## Access to the data
The full data tables, quality and methodology information about the Civil Service Statistics are [published on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-statistics). In addition to the annual publications the Cabinet Office publishes ad-hoc releases throughout the year.

This site provides a user-friendly presentation of the headline statistics and replaces the annual PDF bulletin previously published by the Cabinet Office. The full data tables can be found on GOV.UK, or the data download section allows you to interactive filter and select subsets of the data to that you are most interested in.

Data up to 2018 are also made available via [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/), which is a service provided by the ONS to give users free access to a range of UK labour market statistics from official sources. There maybe small differences in NOMIS figures and ACSES time-series data within this bulletin resulting from ensuring consistency of methodology between this year and previous years.
