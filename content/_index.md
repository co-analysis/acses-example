This prototype is being developed in the open to enable end-user consultation and feedback. All data is from published statistics, however the content is likely to frequently change and therefore should not be relied on for analysis. Moreover, due to the format of the published data files the data reported here is likely to date to 2019.

This site showcases the Civil Service Statistics, it is comprised of three sections:

- The [**key statistics**]({{< ref "keystats/_index.md" >}}) section provides data and visualisation for key themes of interest such as grade, diversity, professions.
- The [**maps**]({{< ref "maps/_index.md" >}}) section allows you to use interactive mapping to explore location based statistics about the Civil Service.
- The [**data**]({{< ref "data" >}}) section allows you to download the statistical data in full or filter and extract subsets of interest.

This is a prototype service and your feedback is welcome.
