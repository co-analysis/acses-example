temporary staff at UK Statistics Authority. See the <a href="/about/#census-2021-temporary-staff">statistical notes</a> for

<li id="fn2"><p>Full-time equivalent (FTE) takes into account the hours
worked by part-time employees. For example, an individual who works 4
days instead of 5 has an FTE value of 0.8. If an organisation had 200
staff (on a headcount basis) and 150 are employed full-time, 20 are
employed for 4 days a week (0.8), 20 are employed for 3 days a week
(0.6) and 10 are employed for 2 days a week (0.4) then the total FTE is
182, which would be reported as 180 (as figures are rounded to the
nearest 10).<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
