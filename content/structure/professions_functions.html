<p>In addition to management structures like grade and organisation,
there are also two important cross-government structures that support
and organise civil servants: professions and Functions.</p>
<p><strong>Professions</strong> support individuals in their career
specialism, such as: economists, lawyers, policy, operational delivery,
and tax inspectors.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong> organise people working on similar
supporting services, such as: commercial, human resources (HR), and
internal audit.</p>
