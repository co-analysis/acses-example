<h2>Grade by organisation</h2>
<p>Organisations with large numbers of front-line and operational staff
delivering public services tend to have a higher proportion of junior
grades. HM Prison and Probation Service has the largest proportion of
staff at an administrative grade (67.7%), while Department for Work and
Pensions (excl. agencies) has the largest number of staff at an
administrative grade (29,320).</p>
<p>Organisations with more senior grades tend to have fewer employees
delivering services directly to the public. Competition and Markets
Authority has the largest proportion of staff at Senior Civil Service
Level (12.9%), while Cabinet Office (excl. agencies) has the largest
number of staff at Senior Civil Service Level (970)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
