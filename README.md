# [WIP] ACSES Publication Example

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo is a work in progress prototype for a future microsite approach to the publication of the [Civil Service Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/civil-service-statistics). 

This prototype is being developed in the open to enable end-user consultation and feedback. All data is from published statistics, however the content is likely to frequently change and therefore should not be relied on for analysis. Moreover, due to the format of the published data files most of the prototype is based on data [published in 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2019).
