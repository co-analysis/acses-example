<description id="sfzgx861923372270285-description">A stacked bar chart showing Civil Service headcount by sex and departmental group. Bars represent the proportion of civil servants in each departmental group by age band (the youngest band, 16-29, is on the and the oldest, 60 and over, is on the right). The departmental groups are arranged by overall headcount, with the largest departmental group (Work and Pensions) at the top and the smallest departmental group (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) at the bottom. Departmental groups with a headcount of less than 1,500 have been grouped together, the bars for this group are shown after those for the smallest group.</description>
