Senior Civil Service Level in 2021, compared to 34.7% in 2011.</p>

Bars represent the proportion of civil servants in each departmental group that are male (the bar starting on the left) and female (the bar starting on the right). The departmental groups are arranged by overall headcount, with the largest departmental group (Work and Pensions) at the top and the smallest departmental group (Ofsted) at the bottom. Departmental groups with a headcount of less than 1,500 have been grouped together, the bars for this group are shown after those for the smallest group.</description>
