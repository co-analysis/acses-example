<description id="vwegm813842297364693-description">A stacked bar chart showing Civil Service headcount by responsibility level and ethnicity. Bars represent the proportion of civil servants in each responsibility level that have declared their ethnicity as White (the bar starting on the left) and those that have declared their ethnicity as an ethnic minority (the bar starting on the right). The bars are ordered by responsibility level with the most senior level at the top and administrative staff at the bottom. The chart does not include data for where either responsbility level or ethnicity are not declared or reported.</description>

<p>The proportion of staff with known national identity who declare a
national identity from outside the United Kingdom is broadly similar
across responsibility levels. However, at junior responsibility levels
data on national identity is less likely to be available than for those
at senior levels.</p>

<description id="xntlp097427609419067-description">A stacked bar chart showing Civil Service headcount by responsibility level and national identity. Bars represent the proportion of civil servants in each responsibility level that have a declared national identity that is not British or Mixed British (that is, either English, Northern Irish,) Welsh, Scottish or another national identity. Bars are sorted by responsibility level with the most senior level at the top and administrative staff at the bottom. The chart does not include data for where either responsbility level or national identity are not declared or reported.</description>
